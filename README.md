# Customer-Purchase-Prediction-on-Synthetic-E-Commerce-Data
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will purchase a product using a synthetic e-commerce dataset. The dataset was initially unlabeled, and I applied manual labeling techniques based on behavioral thresholds. The objective was to build a classification model that can learn from user behavior and predict future purchases.
